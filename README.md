# Data-Cleaning
This project is only about data cleaning. 
In this airline related data cleaning project, Here I have done some other work including missing values in data, different symbols, 
punctuation, unwanted values in strings, converting to proper datatype.

## Key responsibilities:

1. Used regular expression, Bfill, Ffill, Median value to fill missing data or remove symbol, unwanted parts of a string.
2. Along with data cleaning I used describe function, IQR and sometimes skewness method to detect outliers.
3. I have brought the outlier values into the range using the capping method.
4. Converting the features or columns in the data to the proper format and proper data type.
5. Fixing data accuracy and bringing it into structured format.
