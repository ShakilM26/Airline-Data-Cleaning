# Airline Data Cleaning

In addition to working on missing values ​​in this data cleaning project, I worked on several other things. 

## Goal of this project
1. Identify and handle missing data.
2. Identify and correct errors.
3. Find outliers.
4. Fixing structural errors, correct errors, inconsistencies like typo, capitalization, formatting. Make sure the data-type is correct.
5. Deliver and ensure data accuracy and consistency, make sure data completeness.


## Key responsibilities

1. Used regular expression, Bfill, Ffill, median value to fill missing data. 
2. Remove symbol, unwanted parts of a string, .
2. Along with data cleaning I used describe function, IQR and skewness method to detect outliers.
3. I have brought the outlier values into the range using the capping method.
4. Converting the features or columns in the data to the proper format and proper data type.
5. Fixing data accuracy and bringing it into structured format.


## What I learned:
1. Detecting outliers in different ways.
2. Earlier I used to check the describe function only to see the outliers but in addition to this I detected the outliers using Z-score, IQR (Interquartile range).
3. Replace outliers with quantile-based capping method.
